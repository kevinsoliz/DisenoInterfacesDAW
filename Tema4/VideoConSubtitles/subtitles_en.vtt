00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
Each person fights a war within,
a silent struggle

00:05.000 --> 00:07.000
between what they are
and what they could be.

00:08.000 --> 00:12.000
Sometimes we win,
other times we give up,

00:13.000 --> 00:16.000
but the truly brave
are not those who always win,

00:17.000 --> 00:21.000
but those who, even broken,
choose to keep moving forward,

00:22.000 --> 00:26.000
because surrendering
hurts more than falling.

00:27.000 --> 00:29.000
Les Misérables, Victor Hugo.
